A Restaurant AI Agent is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to help restaurants automate and streamline customer interactions and internal operations. It uses natural language understanding to communicate with guests and staff through chat, voice, or integrated digital systems.
1. Workflow Start – Telegram Trigger

The workflow begins when a customer sends a message to the restaurant’s Telegram bot.
The Telegram Trigger node captures this incoming message and passes the message text into the workflow for processing.

2. Passing User Input to the AI Agent

The text received from the customer is forwarded to the AI Agent node.
The agent is configured with a system prompt that instructs it to act as a polite and helpful restaurant assistant.
The AI Agent uses this prompt to understand the customer’s intent (e.g., asking for menu items, making an order, or requesting information).

3. AI Processing Using Google Gemini

The AI Agent sends the customer’s message to the Google Gemini Chat Model, which analyzes the text, interprets the request, and generates a smart, context-aware response.

4. Storing and Maintaining Conversation Memory

The workflow uses a Memory Buffer Window to store recent messages in the conversation.
This allows the AI to remember earlier messages and respond naturally, making the conversation feel continuous and intelligent.

5. Using Google Sheets as Tools

The AI Agent is connected to several Google Sheets that it can use during the conversation:

a. Inventory Sheet

The AI reads this sheet to check menu item availability or ingredient stock.

b. Order Sheet

When the customer places an order, the AI writes the details—such as customer name, food item, quantity, order date, and status—into this sheet.

c. FAQ Sheet

The AI retrieves pre-written answers from this sheet to quickly respond to common customer questions.

The AI decides when to use these sheets depending on what the customer asks.

6. AI Generates the Final Output

After analyzing the message and, if necessary, interacting with Google Sheets, the AI Agent produces the final response text.
This text contains the information or action requested, such as menu recommendations, reservation confirmation, availability updates, or recorded order details.

7. Sending the Response Back to the Customer

The final response generated by the AI is sent back to the customer through the Telegram Send Message node.
The customer receives a clear, polite, and helpful reply directly on Telegram.

8. Workflow Ends

Once the message is delivered, the workflow waits for the next incoming message and repeats the same process, maintaining conversation flow through memory.
